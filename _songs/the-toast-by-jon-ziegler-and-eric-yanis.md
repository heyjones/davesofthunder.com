Looking back
On the memory of
The toast you gave
Stars from Hollywood
For a moment
Guests were horrified
How could I have known
That you’d ever get so high
And now
I swear I didn’t know
The speech would ever end
The impressions that he knows
Hey Shek
It’s not a god damn roast
We all just watched in pain
No one there could miss
The Toast
Working blue
You said everything
For a moment
Martin Luther King
But if I’d only known
The ending of it all
“Hey there bride’s dad”
“The groom might have laid them all”
And now
I swear I didn’t know
The speech would ever end
the impressions that he knows
Hey Shek
It’s not a god damn roast
We all just watched in pain
No one there could miss
The Toast
