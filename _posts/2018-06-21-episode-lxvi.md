Dameshek and Feeney are back in the studio. They receive a special message from Shaquille O’Neal and hear some disturbing clues about Jacuzzi Pete. Plus, the guys receive some listener poetry and make some new offers regarding Mitchell’s Daves of Thunder tattoo. Dameshek also pays tribute to some of Feeney’s past work.
