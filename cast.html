    <h3>Dave Dameshek</h3>
    <p>Dr. Funny (William) Dave Dameshek is a writer and TV/radio host/analyst at the NFL Network who has covered the sports world for the NFL, ESPN, FOX Sports and CBS Radio for the last 15 years. In addition to his fine work on the <em>DoT</em> podcast, Dameshek hosts the <em>Dave Dameshek Football Program (DDFP)</em> podcast. Prior to his stint as a comedy writer and performer on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> (where he once famously ate a piece of fruit live, on air, for all the world to see), Dameshek wrote for such "hit" shows as <em>Sports Geniuses</em>, <em>BattleBots</em>, <em>The Man Show</em>, <em>I'm with Busey</em> and <em>Crank Yankers</em>. Dameshek served as Adam Carolla's sidekick/sports reporter on <em>The Adam Carolla Show</em>, where he was ultimately fired in favor of the wildly talented and more successful Danny Bonaduce. Born on the banks of the Three Rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Dameshek and his many, many children now reside in Los Angeles. After matriculating from Indiana University in Bloomington, in 2010 Dameshek was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in the field of mustard by Barry Levenson, founder and curator of the National Mustard Museum. He is known for his love of sports uniforms and many catchphrases, such as "Hi and hello," "Let's cha-cha" and "on acid." His mission in life? To cut out the noise. Dameshek's fans are members of the Shek Republic.</p>

    <h3>David Feeney</h3>
    <p>David and Feeney is a writer and producer who has been toiling in the entertainment industry since 1997, the same year Princess Diana died. (I'm not saying there's any connection, but I'm not <em>not</em> saying it, either.) In addition to serving as Dave Dameshek's sidekick on the <em>DoT</em> podcast, Feeney wrote the 2015 Reese Witherspon/Sofia Vergara New Line Cinema "hit" <em>Hot Pursuit</em>, which scored <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dont_mess_with_texas_2014/">a whopping 7%</a> on <em>Rotten Tomatoes</em>. Earlier in his career, Feeney famously wrote for jackass Jim Belushi, the mensch who stole Feeney's Vaseline bit when throwing out the first pitch at Chavez Ravine, on <em>According to Jim.</em> Additionally, he wrote for such dynamite programs as <em>2 Broke Girls</em>, <em>Ben and Kate</em>, <em>Bette</em> and the wildly obscure <em>Big Wolf on Campus</em>. Feeney now serves as the writer and executive producer of Fox's <em>New Girl</em>. After several unsuccessful passes at DoT's own Blaster Girl, Feeney settled for "the love of [his] life," Jennifer, who barely tolerates his presences and oft asks him to sleep on the couch. Feeney is best known for his Charles Bukowski impressions, his poetry ("Twice, She Said" and "Advice From a Friend), his famed karaoke duet with Mo Dameshek, and his collections of strange text messages from former <em>DoT</em> producer Jacuzzi Pete (RIP). Feeney's fans are members of the Feenster's Union.</p>

    <h3>Jacuzzi Pete</h3>
    <p>Peter Fowkes, better known to <em>DoT</em> listeners as "Jacuzzi Pete," was the producer of episodes 1 through 63 of the podcast. Pete was taken from us too soon in a tragic ice cream truck accident. He is survived by his wife Nancy and his two children. You can support them in their time of need by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peter-Fowkes/e/B073SKSXYK/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying one of his books</a>. "JP," as he was commonly alluded to by the podcast's hosts, is oft-referenced for his string of drunken, mean-spirited, Mohamed Atta-laden tweets sent to sidekick David Feeney at all hours of the night from both New York hotel rooms and his personal Jacuzzi, where he was known to wash his genital region, Smelly Savalas. Pete is, perhaps, best known for storming out of the Carolla studio after suffering a barrage of fat jokes at the hands of Dameshek and Feeney, who noted that his wife, Nancy, and mother-in-law washed him with "rags on sticks," pointing out that they likely "missed a fold" in the cleaning process. (Suspiciously, Pete's CV does <em>not</em> include the <em>Daves of Thunder</em> podcast.) The ghost of JP now haunts the <em>DoT</em> studios, whose moans have been mistaken for hunger pangs.</p>

    <h3>Blaster Girl</h3>
    <p>Katie Levine, popularly known as Blaster Girl, is a producer on the <em>DoT</em> podcast. She also does production work for other shows on the ACE Broadcasting Network. She is a frequent on-air contributor to <em>DoT</em>, whether it's reading listener e-mails, going on audio blind dates with Tim, throwing herself at David Feeney, making fun of Dameshek, smoking tree, or polishing her big toe. Levine served as the Head of Podcast Productions at the Neridst Network for seven years before realizing Hardwick was a total creep whose only real love is talking about those stupid zombies. Levine attended California State University, where she presumably earned a degree in Surfing. She recently ripped her "heroes" Dameshek and Feeney from nose to tail following her month-long suspension from the podcast due to adulteress-like activity. Additionally, Levine is a lover of both dogs and drugs.</p>

    <h3>Donovan</h3>
    <p>Chris Laxamana is a musician from Long Beach, California. He is also a producer for the Carolla Digital podcast network, including <em>DoT</em>, and is the host of <em>Resume</em> as well as 27 other mediocre podcasts. Laxamana's band, LAXI, is not only a terrible play on "Los Angeles" (LA) but is shamelessly named after himself. Donovan once starred with Doubleton and the Daves of Thunder Players in a short-running podcast series that never took off despite several mentions of "chili dogs."</p>
